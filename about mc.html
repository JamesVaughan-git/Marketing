        The BMCC Marketing Club was established in 2024 by Eric Marlie who majored in digital marketing and James
        Vaughan who majored in business administration. With the help of their club advisor Charles Jamison the
        marketing club was created to provide students with practical experience and a collaborative environment to
        explore the dynamic field of marketing. Recognizing the need for hands-on learning and professional development,
        the founders created the club to empower students through creativity, strategy, and innovation. By engaging in
        real world projects and networking opportunities, members can enhance their skills, build their portfolios, and
        prepare for successful careers in marketing. The club continues to grow as a vibrant community of aspiring
        marketers dedicated to learning, leadership, and collaboration. The marketing club has been able to host many
        events with notable top 500 companies such as Google,Linkedin, Paramount, MTV, and many other notable New York
        based companies
